This repo contains extra code for Course 471 Attendees. It may not make any sense outside
the context of that course. There are half a dozen modules.

The code that duplicates classes in the exercises/solutions is intended to provide
more "modern" (Java 17-era) ways of writing the code.

As a result, of course, you need Java 17 or later to run these projects.
